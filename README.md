# R_ U.S. Electricity Market
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the U.S. Electricity Market using the CRISP-DM methodology. Leveraging data from Kaggle (sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration), the analysis explores electricity consumption, pricing, and revenue trends across various states, sectors, and seasons from 2001 to 2024. Key insights include the inverse relationship between electricity prices and sales, seasonal and regional consumption patterns, and predictive modeling of price, sales, and revenue using regression analysis. The project utilizes R for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling.
